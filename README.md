# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
Use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 

## Results 
This model uses two hidden layers with 80 and 30 neurons. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this model is below the intended 75% goal. Therefore, this is is not a satisfying performance to help predict if applicants would be successful. I tired increasing the number of neurons and hidden layers to help improve the performance but 

## Summary
Despite my best efforts and different modeling approaches, I was unable to surpass the 75% accuracy goal. However, a random forest classier model might help with increasing the accuracy due faster performances and a large number of estimators.
